# Deep learning from scratch
Implementing deep learning algorithms in python with numpy.

## Implementations so far

### Logistic Regression

#### Implementation -> [logistic_regression.ipynb](logistic_regression.ipynb)

#### Architecture
  * Relu in hidden layers and sigmoid in the output layer.
  * Number of layers and number of units in each layer can be set using `layers_dims` hyper-parameter.
  * Uses sigmoid cross entropy for loss computation.

#### Dependencies
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
